            <p>My name is Ty Nelson. I live in Apple Valley and work for a chemical company in Eagan, Minnesota. I spend a lot of my time reading random things and trying to learn new stuff.
                I also spend as much time as I can riding my dirtbike or playing computer games.
                <br>
                <br>
                I was born in Fort Riley, Kansas and moved to Germany for three years right after I born. I spent most of my childhood moving around the country due to my father being in the military, which is a good thing and a bad thing.
                I am looking forward to this class and hope to learn as much as possible in my attempt at a career change.
