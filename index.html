        <p>My name is Ty Nelson. I live in Apple Valley and work for a chemical company in Eagan, Minnesota. I spend a lot of my time reading random things and trying to learn new stuff.
            I also spend as much time as I can riding my dirtbike or playing computer games.
            <br>
            <br>
            I was born in Fort Riley, Kansas and moved to Germany for three years right after I born. I spent most of my childhood moving around the country due to my father being in the military, which is a good thing and a bad thing.
            I am looking forward to this class and hope to learn as much as possible in my attempt at a career change.
